# LED Shirt Editor

## 🎶 Why I Built the LED Shirt Editor

Watching light shows and LED performances, I always wondered:  
*Are the LEDs really “dancing” to the music, or is there someone behind the scenes carefully programming every moment?*  
That question stayed with me.

After building my own LED Music Visualizer, I realized that most existing solutions are either:

- **Too basic** – Simple, microphone-based sound-to-light systems that just flash with volume.  
- **Too rigid** – Pre-programmed shows with little room for creativity on the user’s side.

The goal wasn’t just technical — it was about **creative freedom**.  
I wanted to build a system where anyone — whether a performer, hobbyist, or artist — could make LEDs dance to music exactly the way they imagine.

That’s how the **LED Shirt Editor** was born. ✨

## 🛠️ What This Project Includes

This project is a **complete solution**, consisting of:

1. **Python FastAPI Backend** – Processes music and timeline data.  
2. **Frontend Webpage** – Lets you visually design light shows with an intuitive timeline editor.  
3. **ESP32 Clients** – Execute the commands on the wearable LED shirts in real-time.

## 🎥 Demo

Here’s a quick look at the system in action:

## 🚀 What It Does

In short, it transforms LED performances from being **“automated and hidden”** into something **user-driven, programmable, and interactive**.  

Instead of hardcoding effects, you can directly interact with the **frontend timeline** to design LED light events — making the process as intuitive as editing a video.
